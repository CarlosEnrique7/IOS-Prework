# Pre-work - *Auto Tip*

**Auto Tip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Carlos Chavez**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Added settings page to change the default percentages
- [X] Added Launch screen and app icons
- [X] Used views, constraints, and alignments to make sure app looked well on different device sizes

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I faced were building an app in a whole new language, and also particularly understanding some parts of the app, like user defaults. I also had to get used to using the storyboards, since I started learning using SwiftUI instead. The biggest challenge has been understanding the different states of the application and how to use them effectively for features. At the time of writing I am still attempting to only remember the bill amount across restarts if the time after close was less than 10 min. This has been a challenge so far, but I believe I am getting close with getting my code to run once the app enters the background or comes back to the foreground.
